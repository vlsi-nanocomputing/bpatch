## Overview
Application to generate a patch between two binary files without compression. The differential algorithm is based on the bash command DIFF.
It is available a Python application to encode (generate the patch) and decode (rebuild the new firmware) options. The decode is based on a C code.

## Prerequisite
The application works only on Linux operating system

## How to configure
It is available a script to build and configure the Python script

    sh configure.sh

## How to use
- encode
    
        python3 patch.py encode OLD_FW NEW_FW PATCH [OPTIONS]
    
    options:

        -d         : use diff with option minimal to reduce the patch size"
		-v         : verify che correctness of the patch
		-V         : verify che correctness of the txt patch
		-t FILENAME: write the patch in txt format
		-b FILENAME: write the patch in binary format
		-r FILENAME: write the report in txt format
		-R FILENAME: write the report in csv format

- decode

        python3 patch.py decode OLD_FW PATCH NEW_FW [OPTIONS]

    options:

        -v     : enable verbose mode
		-r SIZE: set the read buffer size
		-p SIZE: set the patch buffer size


## bpatch structure
Are present two instructions: **CPY** to copy bytes from the old firmware, **ADD** to add new bytes. To save the bit to indicate the command in final patch it is assumed that the first instruction is a **CPY** then there is an alternance between **ADD** and **CPY**

- **Patch txt**
    
    Textual patch generated in Python, it is a temporary patch 
    
    CPY format:
            
            0, <nbd>, <nbc>
    - 0: indicate CPY instruction
    - nbd: number of bytes to jump in old firmware
    - nbc: number of bytes to copy from old firmware in new firmware

    ADD format:
            
            1, <nba>, <hex[B1]>, <hex[B2]>, ... <hex[Bnba]>
    - 1: indicate ADD instruction
    - nba: number of bytes to add in new firmware
    - Bn: new bytes in hex format

    example of **Patch txt**

        0,17,1​
        1,3,19,14,38
        [...]

- **Patch bin txt**

    It is the previous patch converted in binary and saved in textual format

    Header format:

        <bin[endpatch]>
        <bin[WNBD]>
        <bin[WNBC]>
        <bin[WNBA]>

    - endpatch: number of bits of the patch
    - WNBD: define the number of bit reserved to \<wnbd\> field
    - WNBC: define the number of bit reserved to \<wnbc\> field
    - WNBA: define the number of bit reserved to \<wnba\> field
    
    [Optional custum fw header]

    *It is possible to define a methodology to built the firmware header*
    
    CPY format:

        0, <bin[wnbd]> <bin[nbd]>, <bin[wnbc]> <bin[nbc]>

    - 0: indicate CPY instruction
    - wnbd: number of bit reserved to next \<nbd\> field
    - nbd: number of bytes to jump in old firmware (if 0 this field is not present)
    - wnbc: number of bit reserved to next \<nbc\> field
    - nbc: number of bytes to copy from old firmware in new firmware
    
    ADD format:
            
            1, <bin[wnba]> <bin[nba]>, <bin[B1]>, <bin[B2]>, ... <bin[Bnba]>
    
    - 1: indicate ADD instruction
    - wnba: number of bit reserved to next \<nba\> field
    - nba: number of bytes to add in new firmware (if 0 this field is not present)
    - Bn: new bytes in bin format

- **Final patch**

    The final patch is generated by the previous patch with the first bit of each instruction line eliminated (instruction bit). The patch is written in binary format



## Custom header

It is possible to define a methodology to generate an header for the firmware.

In *bpatch.py*:

- set *header_fw_size*: size of the custom header in the firmware in bytes
- set *header_patch_size*: size of the custom header in the patch in bits
- set *header_lines*: number of lines of the custom header in the patch
- define *write_header_custom*: function that read the header of the firmware and produce the lines required to re-built the header in **Patch bin txt**

In *bpatch.h*

- enable MACRO *HEADER_PATCH*

In *bpatch.c*

- define *write_header*: function to re-built header for correspondent bytes from the patch

In the repository is present as example a custum header for SBSFU expansion for STM32, detailed [here](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-sbsfu.html)


## CSV report format

Fields of CSV report:

- **fw_size**: size of new firmware in bytes
- **patch_sz**: size of patch in bytes
- **CPY**: number of CPY instructions
- **ADD**: number of ADD instructions
- **NB**: number of new bytes added
- **OVER_NBD**: number of bit necessary to NBD field compared to the total number new bytes in percentage
- **OVER_NBC**: number of bit necessary to NBC field compared to the total number new bytes in percentage
- **OVER_NBA**: number of bit necessary to NBA field compared to the total number new bytes in percentage
- **OVER_TOT**: number of bit necessary to NBD, NBC, NBA fields compared to the total number new bytes in percentage


## Test environment

It is present a **test** folder when the application can be tested and assessed on firmwares

    abstract = {Remote firmware updates in Internet of Things (IoT) devices remain a major challenge due to the constraints of many IoT communication protocols. In particular, transmitting full firmware images over low-bandwidth links such as Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is often impractical. Existing techniques, such as firmware partitioning, can alleviate the problem but are often insufficient, especially for battery-powered devices where time and energy are critical constraints. Consequently, physical maintenance is still frequently required, which is costly and impractical in large-scale deployments. In this work, we introduce bpatch, a lightweight method for generating highly compact delta patches that enable on-device firmware reconstruction. The algorithm is explicitly designed for low-power devices, minimizing memory requirements and computational overhead during the update process. We evaluate bpatch on 173 firmware images across three architectures. Results show that it reduces update payloads by up to 39,000×for near-identical updates and by 9–18×for typical minor revisions, eliminating the need to transmit full firmware images. Experimental results further demonstrate significant time and energy savings, with performance comparable to more complex alternatives. bpatch is released as open-source and, although demonstrated on LoRaWAN, the approach is flexible and can be adapted to other IoT communication technologies.}

## Versioning
We use M.m.p as a verdioning system.

- M = Major
- m = minor
- p = patch

There is always back compatibility among minor version and patches only fix possible bugs
